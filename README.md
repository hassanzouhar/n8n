# 🛠️ n8n Workflows & Snippets
Welcome to my personal collection of n8n workflows, useful code snippets, and automation tricks.
This repo is a growing library of real-world, tested solutions and templates — built to save time, avoid headaches, and automate the boring stuff. 🚀

# 📄 About This Repo

### This repository is a curated set of:
	•	Ready-to-use n8n workflows
	•	Helpful code snippets
	•	Tips & reminders for handling edge cases when building automation in n8n

The goal is simple: Make automation easier, faster, and more reliable — without reinventing the wheel every time.
If you’re using n8n in your daily work or side projects, you’ll probably find something useful here.

# 📝 Reminder:
As JSON is a data-only format, comments are not allowed in JSON files.
All inline comments in the workflow examples must be removed before pasting them into n8n.


# 🚀 Usage
You can copy any workflow from this repo and import it directly into your n8n instance.
Importing
	1.	Copy the .json workflow file.
	2.	In n8n, click Import Workflow → Paste JSON.
	3.	Remove any comments (// ...) before importing.

# 📌 Why This Repo?

Because too many useful workflows, tricks, and solutions disappear into Slack chats, blog posts, or random Notion pages.
This is my own toolbox — but you’re welcome to use it, fork it, and adapt it.

# 🔥 Next
	•	Add a proper folder structure for categories (e.g. PDF, API, Google, FileOps)
	•	More examples coming soon (API integrations, CSV parsing, file monitoring, and more)


Contributions & ideas welcome.
If you find something broken or have a better way — feel free to open an issue or a PR.

**Stay restless. Automate everything.**
